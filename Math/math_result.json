The sum of 46 is also a Fibonacci number because they are both Fibonacci numbers. The sum of 46 is 45, which is a product of 22 times 26 plus 11. This makes 46 a product of 22 and 11, since they are both Fibonacci numbers. The product of 46 is 46, with expectation that it is 22 times 26 plus 11, since they",
